		<p>My name is Aron Patterson, and I'm a Front End Web Developer currently residing in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. I love building websites, whether that website is for a small business or a giant corporate empire, ready to buy out the local Starbucks â€“ I've done it all. Whether you're a business seeking out your place on the world wide web, or a potential employer looking to hire an experienced front-end developer, I'm ready to help you achieve your goals! Feel free to <a ng-href="/#!about">learn more about me</a>; check out a small batch of my <a ng-href="/#!developer-portfolio">custom-developed sites</a>; or cut out the middle man by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aronpatterson" target="_blank">messaging me on LinkedIn <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.</p>
		<p>In addition to being a seasoned web developer, I've worn many hats in the past, including: web designer; SEO expert; online marketer; client trainer; and development project manager. That means if you're looking for a full-rounded developer who can hit the ground running, you've found one of the best.</p>
