		<p>My name is Aron Patterson, and I'm a Front End Web Developer from Duluth, Minnesota. I love building websites, whether that website is for a small business or a giant corporate empire ready to buy out my local Starbucks â€“ I've done it all. Whether you're a business seeking out your place on the world wide web, or a potential employer looking to hire an experienced developer, I will help you achieve your goals! Feel free to <a href="http://aroonline.com/#/about">learn more about me</a>; check out a small batch of my <a href="http://aroonline.com/developer-portfolio/">custom-developed sites</a>; or cut out the middle man by <a data-open="contactForm">contacting me directly</a>.</p>
		<p>In addition to being a seasoned web developer, I've worn many hats in the past, including: web designer; SEO expert; online marketer; client trainer; and development project manager. That means if you're looking for a full-rounded web developer who can hit the ground running, you've found one of the best.</p>
